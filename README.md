            <h2>4. Tools, Technologies, and Platform used:
            </h2>
            <p><li><h2>Tkinter:</h2>
                Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. 
                Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.
                 Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
                In this Project tkinter Library will be used for creating The Whole GUI of Project.</li>
                <li><h2>Os:</h2>
                    The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. 
                    OS comes under Python's standard utility modules. 
                    This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.
                    In this Project We are Using OS to Work Between Different Python Files Together.
                    </li>
                    <li><h2>DateTime Module:</h2>
                        In Python, date and time are not a data type of its own, but a module named datetime can be imported to work with the date as well as time
                        DateTime Module is important for this project as for keeping records of data With Proper Date And time

                            <h2>Sqlite 3:</h2>
            SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
            SQLite3 can be integrated with Python using sqlite3 module.<br>
